PReLearn README
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

PReLearn is a preprocesor that learns PR clauses.
The clauses can be added to the original formula, then solved by a 
SAT solver.
PReLearn additionally outputs proofs in the dpr format.

PReLearn was built on top of SaDiCaL, using the inner solver to solve
reducts but modifying the outer solver to search for PR clauses 
exclusively.

Options labelled pre_[option] are speciic to PReLearn, the remaining
options are from SaDiCaL. Some of the SaDiCaL options are inapplicable 
since PReLearn does not use the outer solver for SAT solving like in
SaDiCaL.

To build use

  ./configure.sh && make 

You can compile with debugging, checking or logging support too. See

  ./configure. -h

for configuration options.  By default the code is optimized and neither
assertion checking nor logging code is included.


Original SaDiCaL README
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SaDiCaL is a Satisfaction Driven Clause Learning (SDCL) SAT Solver.
Beside standard conflict clauses it also learns Set Propagation
Redundant (SPR) clauses, by checking the (filtered) positive reduct
of the current partial assignment to be satisfiable.
